# GuidFixer
UE5 Plugin (5.0) for resolving conflicting material IDs that cause errors in Swarm build and conflicting texture IDs that cause errors in texture streaming builds.

After placing in project>plugins, regenerating and stuff you should have new button on the toolbar called SwarmGuidFixer.
Load that problematic level, click the button and then Save All.

Much love and thanks to the original plugin for fixing the errors in conflicting material IDs, as well as the forums post it originated from.
